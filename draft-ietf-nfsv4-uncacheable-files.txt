          Adding an Uncacheable File Data Attribute to NFSv4.2
               draft-ietf-nfsv4-uncacheable-files-latest

Abstract

   Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) clients commonly perform
   client-side caching of file data in order to improve performance.  On
   some systems, applications may influence client data caching
   behavior, but there is no standardized mechanism for a server or
   administrator to indicate that particular file data should not be
   cached by clients for reasons of performance or correctness.  This
   document introduces a new file data caching attribute for NFSv4.2.
   Files marked with this attribute are intended to be accessed with
   client-side caching of file data suppressed, in order to support
   workloads that require predictable data visibility.  This document
   extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7862).

1.  Introduction

   Clients of remote filesystems commonly perform client-side caching of
   file dat in order to improve performance.  Such caching may include
   retaining data read from the server to satisfy subsequent READ
   requests, as well as retaining data written by applications in order
   to delay or combine WRITE requests before transmitting them to the
   server.  While these techniques are effective for many workloads,
   they may be unsuitable for workloads that require predictable data
   visibility or involve concurrent modification of shared files by
   multiple clients.

   In some cases, Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) (see
   [RFC7862]) mechanisms such as file delegations can reduce the impact
   of concurrent access.  However, delegations are not always available
   or effective, particularly for workloads with frequent concurrent
   writers or rapidly changing access patterns.

   There have been prior efforts to bypass file data caching in order to
   address these issues.  In High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads,
   file data caching is often bypassed to improve predictability and to
   avoid read-modify-write hazards when multiple clients write disjoint
   byte ranges of the same file.

   Applications on some systems can request bypass of the client data
   cache by opening files with the O_DIRECT flag (see [OPEN-O_DIRECT]).
   However, this approach has limitations, including the requirement
   that each application be explicitly modified and the lack of a
   standardized mechanism for communicating this intent between servers
   and clients.

   This document introduces the uncacheable file data attribute to
   NFSv4.2.  This OPTIONAL attribute allows a server to indicate that
   client-side caching of file data for a particular file is unsuitable.
   When both the client and the server support this attribute, the
   client is advised suppress client-side caching of file data for that
   file, in accordance with the semantics defined in this document.

   The uncacheable file data attribute is read-write, applies on a per-
   file basis, and has a data type of boolean.

   Support for the uncacheable file data attribute is specific to the
   exported filesystem and may differ between filesystems served by the
   same server.  A client can determine whether the attribute is
   supported for a given file by issuing a GETATTR request and examining
   the returned attribute list.

   The uncacheable file data attribute applies only to regular files
   (NF4REG).  Attempts to query or set this attribute on objects of
   other types MUST result in an error of NFS4ERR_INVAL.  Since the
   uncacheable file data attribute applies only to regular files,
   attempts to apply it to other object types represent an invalid use
   of the attribute.

   Using the process described in [RFC8178], the revisions in this
   document extend NFSv4.2 [RFC7862].  They are built on top of the
   external data representation (XDR) [RFC4506] generated from
   [RFC7863].

1.1.  Definitions

   client-side caching of file data  The retention of file data by a
      client in a local data cache, commonly referred to as the page
      cache, for the purpose of satisfying subsequent READ requests or
      delaying transmission of WRITE data to the server.

   write-behind caching  A form of file data caching in which WRITE data
      is retained by the client and transmission of the data to the
      server is delayed in order to combine multiple WRITE operations or
      improve efficiency.

   direct I/O  An access mode in which file data is transferred between
      application buffers and the underlying storage without populating
      or consulting the client's file data cache.  Direct I/O suppresses
      both read caching and write-behind caching of file data.

   write hole  A write hole is an instance of data corruption that
      arises when multiple clients modify disjoint byte ranges within
      the same encoded data block without having a consistent view of
      the existing contents.  This can result in stale data overwriting
      newer updates, particularly in environments that use erasure
      encoding or striped storage.  (Adapted from
      [I-D.haynes-nfsv4-flexfiles-v2].)

   This document assumes familiarity with the NFSv4 protocol operations,
   error codes, object types, and attributes as defined in [RFC8881].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Client-Side Caching of File Data

   The uncacheable file data attribute advises the client to bypass its
   page cache for a file in certain troublesome cases.  These include
   forms of client-side caching of file data such as write-behind
   caching, in which multiple pending WRITEs are combined and
   transmitted to the server at a later time for efficiency.  The
   uncacheable file data attribute inhibits such behavior with an effect
   similar to that of using the O_DIRECT flag with the open call
   ([OPEN-O_DIRECT]).

   The intent of this attribute is to allow a server or administrator to
   indicate that client-side caching of file data for a particular file
   is unsuitable.  The server is often in a better position than
   individual clients to determine sharing patterns, access behavior, or
   correctness requirements associated with a file.  By exposing this
   information via an attribute, the server can advise clients to
   suppress file data caching in a consistent manner.

   One important use case for this attribute arises in connection with
   High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads.  These workloads often
   involve large data transfers and concurrent access by multiple
   clients.  In such environments, client-side caching of file data can
   introduce unpredictable latency or correctness hazards when data is
   buffered and flushed at a later time.

   Another aspect of such workloads is the need to support concurrent
   writers to shared files.  When application data spans a data block in
   a client cache, delayed transmission of WRITE data can result in
   clients modifying stale data and overwriting updates written by
   others.  Prompt transmission of WRITE data enables the prompt
   detection of write holes and reduces the risk of data corruption.

2.1.  Non-Goals

   This attribute does not require clients to provide strict coherency,
   does not replace existing NFS cache consistency mechanisms, and does
   not mandate any specific client implementation strategy.  It provides
   advisory guidance intended to reduce latency and correctness risks in
   selected workloads.

2.2.  Uncacheable File Data

   When a file object is marked as uncacheable file data, the attribute
   advises the client that client-side caching of file data for the file
   is unsuitable.  In particular, the client is advised to transmit
   modifications to the file promptly rather than retaining them in a
   local data cache.  Note that a client that does not query this
   attribute cannot be expected to observe the behavior described in
   this section.

   For uncacheable file data, the client is advised not to retain file
   data in its local data cache for the purpose of satisfying subsequent
   READ requests or delaying transmission of WRITE data.  In such cases,
   READ operations bypass the client data cache, and WRITE data is not
   retained for read-after-write satisfaction or for the purpose of
   combining multiple WRITE requests.

   Caching of unstably written data used to reissue WRITEs lost because
   of server failure prior to COMMIT is not affected by the advice
   provided by the uncacheable file data attribute.  This is because the
   server is made aware of the WRITE operation without the sort of
   delays introduced by write-behind caching.

   Suppressing read caching in addition to suppressing write-behind
   caching reduces the risk of stale-data overwrite in multi-writer
   workloads.  If a client retains cached READ data while other clients
   concurrently modify disjoint byte ranges of the same file, the client
   may perform a read-modify-write operation using stale data and
   overwrite updates written by others.  This risk exists even when
   WRITE operations are transmitted promptly.

   Disabling READ caching allows clients to observe the most recent data
   prior to modification and reduces read-modify-write hazards for
   shared files.  This behavior is consistent with direct I/O semantics
   such as those provided by the O_DIRECT flag in Linux and the
   directio/forcedirectio mechanisms in Solaris.

   If the fattr4_uncacheable_file_data attribute is not set when a file
   is opened and is changed while the file is open, the client is not
   expected to retroactively alter its caching behavior.  A client may
   choose to flush cached data and apply the advice to subsequent I/O,
   but such behavior is not required until the file is closed and
   reopened.

   The presence of the uncacheable file data attribute does not
   invalidate file delegations.  A server that wishes to ensure prompt
   client I/O may choose not to issue write delegations for files marked
   as uncacheable, but clients are not required to suppress delegations
   solely due to the presence of this attribute.

3.  Setting the Uncacheable File Data Attribute

   The uncacheable file data attribute provides a mechanism by which
   applications that do not support O_DIRECT can request DIRECT-I/O-like
   semantics for file access.  In particular, the attribute allows a
   server to advise clients that client-side caching of file data for a
   file is unsuitable, including both read caching and write-behind
   caching.

   Suppressing read caching is necessary in addition to suppressing
   write-behind caching to avoid read-modify-write hazards in multi-
   writer workloads.  If clients retain cached READ data while other
   clients concurrently modify disjoint byte ranges of the same file,
   stale cached data may be merged with new WRITE data and overwrite
   updates written by others.  This risk exists even when WRITE data is
   transmitted promptly and is not addressed by suppressing write-behind
   caching alone.

   One possible deployment model is for a server or administrator to
   configure a mount (see [MOUNT]) option such that newly created files
   under a given export are marked as uncacheable file data.  In such a
   configuration, the NFSv4.2 client could use SETATTR to set the
   fattr4_uncacheable_file_data attribute at file creation time.

   This approach is conceptually similar int intent to the Solaris
   forcedirectio mount option (see [SOLARIS-FORCEDIRECTIO]), but differs
   in scope and visibility in that it allows DIRECT-I/O-like behavior to
   be applied without requiring changes to individual applications.
   However, unlike the Solaris option, the NFSv4.2 attribute is visible
   to all clients accessing the file and is intended to convey server-
   side knowledge or policy in a distributed environment.

4.  Implementation Status

   There is a prototype Hammerspace server which implements the
   uncacheable file data attribute and a prototype Linux client which
   treats the uncacheable file data attribute as an indication to use
   O_DIRECT.  For the prototype, all files created under the mount point
   have the fattr4_uncacheable_file_data set to be true.

   Experience with the prototype indicates that the uncacheable file
   data attribute can provide many of the practical benefits of O_DIRECT
   without requiring application modification.  For applications that
   issue well-formed I/O requests, this approach has been observed to
   improve performance in many cases, while also reducing memory
   pressure and CPU utilization in the NFS client.

5.  XDR for Uncacheable Attribute

   ///
   /// typedef bool            fattr4_uncacheable_file_data;
   ///
   /// const FATTR4_UNCACHEABLE_FILE_DATA       = 87;
   ///

6.  Extraction of XDR

   This document contains the external data representation (XDR)
   [RFC4506] description of the uncacheable file attribute.  The XDR
   description is presented in a manner that facilitates easy extraction
   into a ready-to-compile format.  To extract the machine-readable XDR
   description, use the following shell script:

   <CODE BEGINS>
   #!/bin/sh
   grep '^ *///' $* | sed 's?^ */// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'
   <CODE ENDS>

   For example, if the script is named 'extract.sh' and this document is
   named 'spec.txt', execute the following command:

   <CODE BEGINS>
   sh extract.sh < spec.txt > uncacheable_prot.x
   <CODE ENDS>

   This script removes leading blank spaces and the sentinel sequence
   '///' from each line.  XDR descriptions with the sentinel sequence
   are embedded throughout the document.

   Note that the XDR code contained in this document depends on types
   from the NFSv4.2 nfs4_prot.x file (generated from [RFC7863]).  This
   includes both nfs types that end with a 4, such as offset4, length4,
   etc., as well as more generic types such as uint32_t and uint64_t.

   While the XDR can be appended to that from [RFC7863], the code
   snippets should be placed in their appropriate sections within the
   existing XDR.

7.  Security Considerations

   The attribute does not introduce new authorization mechanisms or
   alter existing access control semantics; existing NFSv4.2 security
   mechanisms continue to apply.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
