          Adding an Uncacheable File Data Attribute to NFSv4.2
               draft-ietf-nfsv4-uncacheable-files-latest

Abstract

   The Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) allows a client to
   cache data for file objects.  Caching file data can lead to
   performance issues if the cache hit rate is low.  This document
   introduces a new uncacheable file data attribute for NFSv4.2.  Files
   marked as uncacheable MUST NOT have their data be stored in client-
   side caches.  This document extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7862).

1.  Introduction

   With a remote filesystem, the client typically caches file contents
   in order to improve performance.  Several assumptions are made about
   the rate of change in the number of clients trying to concurrently
   access a file.  With NFSv4.2, this could be mitigated by file
   delegations for the file contents.

   There are prior efforts to bypass file caching.  In Highly Parallel
   Computing (HPC) workloads, file caching is bypassed in order to
   achieve consistent work flows.

   This document introduces the uncacheable file data attribute to
   NFSv4.2 to bypass file caching on the client.  As such, it is an
   OPTIONAL attribute to implement for NFSv4.2.  However, if both the
   client and the server support this attribute, then the client MUST
   follow the semantics of the uncacheable file data attribute.

   The uncacheable file data attribute is read-only and per file.  The
   data type is bool.

   A client can easily determine whether or not a server supports the
   uncacheable file data attribute with a simple GETATTR on any file.
   If the server does not support the uncacheable file data attribute,
   it will return an error of NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP.

   The only way that the server can determine that the client supports
   the attribute is if the client sends either a GETATTR with the
   uncacheable file data attribute.

   As bypassing file caching is file based, it is only applicable for
   dirents which are of type attribute value of NF4REG.

   Using the process detailed in [RFC8178], the revisions in this
   document become an extension of NFSv4.2 [RFC7862].  They are built on
   top of the external data representation (XDR) [RFC4506] generated
   from [RFC7863].

1.1.  Definitions

   file caching  A client cache, normally called the page cache, which
      caches the contents of a regular file.  Typical usage would be to
      accumulate changes to be bunched together for writing to the
      server.

   Further, the definitions of the following terms are referenced as
   follows:

   *  file delegations (Section 10.2 of [RFC8881])

   *  GETATTR (Section 18.7 of [RFC8881])

   *  NF4REG (Section 5.8.1.2 of [RFC8881])

   *  NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP (Section 15.1.15.1 of [RFC8881])

   *  SETATTR (Section 18.30 of [RFC8881])

   *  system (Section 5.8.2.36 of [RFC8881])

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Caching of File Data

   The uncacheable file data attribute instructs the client to bypass
   its page cache for the file.  This behavior is similar to using the
   O_DIRECT flag with the open call ([open]).  This can be beneficial
   for files that are not shared or do not exhibit access patterns
   suitable for caching.

   However, the real need for bypassing write caching is evident in HPC
   workloads.  In general, these involve massive data transfers and
   require extremely low latency.  Write caching can introduce
   unpredictable latency, as data is buffered and flushed later.

2.1.  Uncacheable Files

   If a file object is marked as uncacheable file data, all
   modifications to the file MUST be immediately sent from the client to
   the server.

3.  XDR for Uncacheable Attribute

   ///
   /// typedef bool            fattr4_uncacheable_file_data;
   ///
   /// const FATTR4_UNCACHEABLE_FILE_DATA       = 87;
   ///

4.  Extraction of XDR

   This document contains the external data representation (XDR)
   [RFC4506] description of the uncacheable file attribute.  The XDR
   description is presented in a manner that facilitates easy extraction
   into a ready-to-compile format.  To extract the machine-readable XDR
   description, use the following shell script:

   #!/bin/sh
   grep '^ *///' $* | sed 's?^ */// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'

   For example, if the script is named 'extract.sh' and this document is
   named 'spec.txt', execute the following command:

   sh extract.sh < spec.txt > uncacheable_prot.x

   This script removes leading blank spaces and the sentinel sequence
   '///' from each line.  XDR descriptions with the sentinel sequence
   are embedded throughout the document.

   Note that the XDR code contained in this document depends on types
   from the NFSv4.2 nfs4_prot.x file (generated from [RFC7863]).  This
   includes both nfs types that end with a 4, such as offset4, length4,
   etc., as well as more generic types such as uint32_t and uint64_t.

   While the XDR can be appended to that from [RFC7863], the code
   snippets should be placed in their appropriate sections within the
   existing XDR.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document imposes no new security considerations to NFSv4.2.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
