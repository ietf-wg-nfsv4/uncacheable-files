               Adding an Uncacheable Attribute to NFSv4.2
                  draft-ietf-nfsv4-uncacheable-latest

Abstract

   The Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) allows a client to
   cache both metadata and data for file objects, as well as metadata
   for directory objects.  While caching directory entries (dirents) can
   improve performance, it can also prevent the server from enforcing
   access control on individual dirents.  Similarly, caching file data
   can lead to performance issues if the cache hit rate is low.  This
   document introduces a new uncacheable attribute for NFSv4.  Files and
   dirents marked as uncacheable MUST NOT be stored in client-side
   caches.  This ensures data consistency and integrity by requiring
   clients to always retrieve the most recent data directly from the
   server.  This document extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7862).

1.  Introduction

   With a remote filesystem, the client typically caches both directory
   entries (dirents) and file contents in order to improve performance.
   Several assumptions are made about the rate of change in the dirents
   and the number of clients trying to concurrently access a file.  With
   NFSv4.2, this could theoretically be mitigated by directory
   delegations for the dirents and practically by file delegations for
   the file contents.

   There are prior efforts to bypass both the dirent and file caching.
   Access Based Enumeration (ABE) is used in Server Message Block (SMB)
   [SMB2] protocol to effectively limit the namespace visibility per
   user.  In Highly Parallel Computing (HPC) workloads, file caching is
   bypassed in order to achieve consistent work flows.

   This document introduces the uncacheable attribute to NFSv4.2 to
   implement ABE and to bypass file caching on the client.  As such, it
   is an OPTIONAL to implement attribute for NFSv4.2.  However, if both
   the client and the server support this attribute, then the client
   MUST follow the semantics of uncacheable.
   // What about mixed modes?

   A client can easily determine whether or not a server supports the
   uncacheable attribute with a simple GETATTR on any dirent.  If the
   server does not support the uncacheable attribute, it will return an
   error of NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP.

   The only way that the server can determine that the client supports
   the attribute is if the client sends either a GETATTR or a SETATTR
   with the uncacheable attribute.

   While some argument could be made to introduce two new attributes,
   the functionality of the uncacheable attribute dictates which cache
   is to be bypassed.  As ABE is concerned with walking the namespace,
   it is only applicable to be acted on dirents which are of type
   attribute value of NF4DIR.  And as bypassing file caching is file
   based, it is only applicable for dirents which are of type attribute
   value of NF4REG.
   // What about the other file types?

   Using the process detailed in [RFC8178], the revisions in this
   document become an extension of NFSv4.2 [RFC7862].  They are built on
   top of the external data representation (XDR) [RFC4506] generated
   from [RFC7863].

1.1.  Definitions

   Access Based Enumeration (ABE)  When servicing a READDIR or GETATTR
      operation, the server provides results based on the access
      permissions of the user making the request.

   dirent  A directory entry, representing either a file or a
      subdirectory.  In the context of NFSv4, a dirent marked as
      uncacheable MUST NOT be cached by clients.

   dirent caching  A client cache that is used to avoid looking up
      attributes.

   file caching  A client cache, normally called the page cache, which
      caches the contents of a regular file.  Typical usage would be to
      accumulate changes to be bunched together for writing to the
      server.

   Further, the definitions of the following terms are referenced as
   follows:

   *  directory delegations (Section 10.9 of [RFC8881])

   *  file delegations (Section 10.2 of [RFC8881])

   *  GETATTR (Section 18.7 of [RFC8881])

   *  hidden (Section 5.8.2.15 of [RFC8881])

   *  Mandatory Access Control (MAC) ([RFC4949])

   *  NF4DIR (Section 5.8.1.2 of [RFC8881])

   *  NF4REG (Section 5.8.1.2 of [RFC8881])

   *  NFS4ERR_ATTRNOTSUPP (Section 15.1.15.1 of [RFC8881]

   *  mode (Section 6.2.4 of [RFC8881])

   *  offline (Section 2 of [I-D.ietf-nfsv4-delstid])

   *  owner (Section 5.8.2.26 of [RFC8881])

   *  owner_group (Section 5.8.2.27 of [RFC8881])

   *  READDIR (Section 18.23 of [RFC8881])

   *  SETATTR (Section 18.30 of [RFC8881])

   *  system (Section 5.8.2.36 of [RFC8881])

   *  type (Section 5.8.1.2 of [RFC8881])

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Caching of Dirents

   With a remote filesystem, the client typically caches directory
   entries (dirents) locally to improve performance.  This cooperation
   succeeds because both the server and client operate under POSIX
   semantics ([POSIX.1]) and agree to interpretation of mode bits with
   respect to the uid and gid in NFSv3 [RFC1813].  For NFSv4.2, these
   would respectively be the mode, owner, and owner_group attributes
   defined in Section 5 of [RFC8881].  Note that this cooperation does
   not apply to Access Control List (ACLs) entries as NFSv4.2 does not
   implement a strict POSIX style ACL.

   NFSv4.2 does implement NFSv4.1 ACLs, which are enforced on the server
   and not the client.  As such, ACL enforcement requires the client to
   bypass the dirent cache to have checks done when a new user attempts
   to access the dirent.

   Another consideration is that not all server implementations natively
   support the SMB [SMB2].  Instead, they layer Samba [Samba] on top of
   the NFSv4.2 service.  The attributes of hidden, system, and offline
   have already been introduced in the NFSv4.2 protocol to support
   Samba.  The Samba implementation can utilize these attributes to
   provide SMB semantics.  While private protocols can supply these
   features, it is better to drive them into open standards.

   Another concept that can be adapted from SMB is that of Access Based
   Enumeration (ABE).  If a share or a folder has ABE enabled, then the
   user can only see the files and sub-folders for which they have
   permissions.

   Under the POSIX model, this can be done on the client and not the
   server.  However, that only works with uid, gid, and mode bits.  If
   we consider identity mappings, ACLS, and server local policies, then
   the determination of ABE MUST be done on the server.

   Since cached dirents are shared by all users on a client, and the
   client cannot determine access permissions for individual dirents,
   all users are presented with the same set of attributes.  To address
   this, this document introduces the new uncacheable attribute.  This
   attribute instructs the client not to cache the dirent for a file or
   directory object.  Consequently, each time a client queries for these
   attributes, the server's response can be tailored to the specific
   user making the request.

2.1.  Uncacheable Dirents

   If a file object or directory has the uncacheable attribute set, then
   the client MUST NOT cache its dirent attributes.  This means that
   even if the client has previously retrieved the attributes for a
   user, it MUST query the server again for those attributes on
   subsequent requests.  Additionally, the client MUST NOT share
   attributes between different users.

3.  Caching of File Data

   In addition to caching metadata, clients can also cache file data.
   The uncacheable attribute also instructs the client to bypass its
   page cache for the file.  This behavior is similar to using the
   O_DIRECT flag with the open call ([open]).  This can be beneficial
   for files that are not shared or for files that do not exhibit access
   patterns suitable for caching.

   However, the real need for bypassing write caching is evident in HPC
   workloads.  In general, these involve massive data transfers and
   require extremely low latency.  Write caching can introduce
   unpredictable latency, as data is buffered and flushed later.

3.1.  Uncacheable Files

   If a file object is marked as uncacheable, all modifications to the
   file MUST be immediately sent from the client to the server.  In
   other words, the file data is also not cacheable.

4.  XDR for Offline Attribute

   ///
   /// typedef bool            fattr4_uncacheable;
   ///
   /// const FATTR4_UNCACHEABLE            = 87;
   ///

5.  Extraction of XDR

   This document contains the external data representation (XDR)
   [RFC4506] description of the uncacheable attribute.  The XDR
   description is presented in a manner that facilitates easy extraction
   into a ready-to-compile format.  To extract the machine-readable XDR
   description, use the following shell script:

   #!/bin/sh
   grep '^ *///' $* | sed 's?^ */// ??' | sed 's?^ *///$??'

   For example, if the script is named 'extract.sh' and this document is
   named 'spec.txt', execute the following command:

   sh extract.sh < spec.txt > uncacheable_prot.x

   This script removes leading blank spaces and the sentinel sequence
   '///' from each line.  XDR descriptions with the sentinel sequence
   are embedded throughout the document.

   Note that the XDR code contained in this document depends on types
   from the NFSv4.2 nfs4_prot.x file (generated from [RFC7863]).  This
   includes both nfs types that end with a 4, such as offset4, length4,
   etc., as well as more generic types such as uint32_t and uint64_t.

   While the XDR can be appended to that from [RFC7863], the code
   snippets should be placed in their appropriate sections within the
   existing XDR.

6.  Security Considerations

   For a given user A, a client MUST NOT make access decisions for
   uncacheable dirents retrieved for another user B.  These decisions
   MUST be made by the server.  If the client is Labeled NFS aware
   ([RFC7204]), then the client MUST locally enforce the MAC security
   policies.

   The uncacheable attribute allows dirents to be annotated such that
   attributes are presented to the user based on the server's access
   control decisions.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
